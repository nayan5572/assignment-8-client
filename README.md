<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

* Add at least 3 project features

There are 3 important tasks of my project.
  1.  First I created the layout of the web site.  
  2.  Clicking the card on my web site stores the values ​​in a new state.  
  3.  Then at the end of all I made a chart of total donation and my donation.
